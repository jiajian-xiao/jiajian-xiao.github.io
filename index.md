## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="DSCF3582.jpg">

I am currently a research fellow at TUMCREATE, Singapore. 

I have been heavily involved in a number of local (Singapore) and international (collaborating with research entities in Germany and China) research projects.

## Education

2007 - 2011	B.Eng.		Shanghai Jiao Tong University
2011 - 2013	M.Sc.		Technical University of Munich (TUM)
2016 - 2022	Ph.D 		Technical University of Munich (TUM)

## Research Interests

My research interests include high-performance computing with a special focus on using heterogeneous hardware to accelerate agent-based simulations, general agent-based modeling & simulation, and smart transportation problems.

## Research Projects

### [Singapore Integrated Transport and Energy Model (SITEM)](https://www.tum-create.edu.sg/content/sitem-singapore-integrated-transport-and-energy-model)
A\*STAR’s Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC) and TUMCREATE Ltd (TUMCREATE) are working together on a research project that supports Singapore’s planning for the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) nationwide. The Singapore Integrated Transport Energy Model (SITEM) will be used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of projected electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns and energy demand, which will support policymaking on Singapore’s budget 2040 vision for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy and contribute towards Singapore’s decarbonisation commitments. The research project is commissioned by the Science and Technology Policy and Plans Office (S&TPPO), Prime Minister’s Office, and aims to advance the nation’s capabilities in integrated modelling and simulation of transport and power systems.

### [TUMCREATE Virtual Interactive Lab](https://ars.electronica.art/futurelab/en/projects-tumcreate/)
Collaborating with Future lab at ARS Electronica (Linz, Austria) to develop a unique research and demonstrator platform for urban mobility - which merges the interdisciplinary scientific expertise of TUMCREATE with the available technology for virtual reality.
